        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
          <p>
            Mei Tea is a small family-owned bubble tea shop I work at.
           This project involved redesigning the menu completely for improved user experience.

      <h3>WHY REDESIGN?</h3>
      <p>
        The old menu was over 3 years old and we needed a menu that included
        new products and removed discontinued items as well. Customers found the old 
        menu difficult to navigate through quickly, and there was plenty of missing
        items in each drink category.

        images/menuprogress-640.jpg 2x,

        alt="menuprogress"/>

         <h3>WORK PROCESS</h3>
         <p>
          First I redesigned the logo to fit the theme and aesthetic of the shop. 
          I based it on the old logo where it incorporates a pink cherry blossom. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The owner wanted the menu to be printed on letter sized paper, thus I 
          based my wireframes around how it would look on that size. I experimented 
          with vertical and horizontal designs, as well as how I might be able to fit
          everything onto one page.
          </p>
          <p>
          I included an how to order section to the menu since there are constantly
          new customers asking about it daily. It creates less confusion and 
          more understanding of all the customizable options of boba.
          </p>
        </div>
      <div class="casetext">
        <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>I ended up choosing a vertical design with the steps and logo at the top. 
        It was more user friendly and easier to read through efficiently. 
        I chose to use 2 sheets of paper to connect the design since the menu had
        such a large selection. The vertical layout also made it easier to have text 
        that does not cut off during the printing.
